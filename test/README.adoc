= Tests for NorthEats API

== How to run NorthEats Tests

Navigate to the parent `NorthEats_API` folder and run:

 $ cd NorthEats_API
 $ mocha "test/**/*.js"

This will run all of the .js testing files using the mocha testing package

== Test Organization

* One file tests one function
  ** In order to keep testing files relatively short and concise, each file should contain a test suite for one function only
  ** This test suite should include
    *** Positive cases: What should happen when the interaction should be successful?
    *** Negative cases: What should happen when an error should be thrown?
    *** (Optional) Exception cases: For select methods, we should test that we are throwing the right exceptions.

== Naming scheme for testing files

* We are implementing a standardized naming scheme for testing files. This will allow us to tell what the file tests just by looking at its name.

Here is how each file should be named:

**test-{method type}{url}.js**

* Method type
** Examples - GET, PUT, POST, DELETE

* url
** Examples - restaurant, restaurant-'restaurantId', menu-'menuId'
*** Because we can't include colons (:) or slashes (/) in file names, we are going to sub in dashes (-) and apostrophes (') instead

* Example file name: test-{GET}{restaurant-'restaurantId'}.js
** (This file would contain tests for the 'GET /restaurant/:restaurantId' method)
